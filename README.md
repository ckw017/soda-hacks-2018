# Cloud Vision App


App that links camera video feed to the Google Cloud Vision and Translate API

Creates an overlay over the video feed that either describes and translates objects in the image or translates any text found.

The original idea was to use at as an AR thing for traveling to different countries, so that you can figure out the native words for things in your field of view.


# Features
- Support for any language that Google translate supports
- Text recognition and translation
- Simple to use interface
